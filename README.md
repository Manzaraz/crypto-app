Hello World, I'm Christian Manzaraz and this time I built [Cryptoverse](https://cripto-app.netlify.app) a cryptocurrency application.

## As you can see, I worked on:

- Full-responsive design
- On the home page, you can see the top 10 cryptocurrencies and the last six world news on this topic.
- In the Cryptocurrencies section you can see the first hundred digital currencies.
- In Exchanges I had the problem that to access to this endpoint, I need to have a Premium Plan. You can check if you inspect the page and check the console, you will find this message:
  ```javascript
  The resource could not be loaded: the server responded with a status of 401 (unauthorized)
  ```
- In the News section, you can find the latest twelve news about digital currencies and you can find more news by selecting by name in the search box.

- And if you click on any cryptocurrency card, the application can show us a graph about the price of the cryptocurrency selected over time, and all their Stats

## For this example I used tools like:

- Data from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com).
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Ant-Design](https://ant.design/) & @ant-design/icons
- [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- [React Chartjs 2](https://react-chartjs-2.netlify.app/)
- [millify](https://github.com/izolate/millify)
- [React Router Dom v6](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview)
- [html-react-parser](https://github.com/remarkablemark/html-react-parser)
